                                    When sharing creative works online, it's essential to understand the conditions
                                    under which others can use, modify, and distribute them. Various licensing options
                                    exist to govern these conditions, providing creators with flexibility in how they
                                    want their works to be shared and used. These licenses, ranging from permissive to
                                    restrictive, offer different levels of freedom and protection to both creators and
                                    users. Below are seven common conditions of use licenses, each with its own terms
                                    and implications.
