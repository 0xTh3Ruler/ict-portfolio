                                    lessons for their students. With Edpuzzle, educators can select existing videos from
                                    various sources, such as YouTube, Khan Academy, and National Geographic, or upload
                                    their own videos, and enhance them with customized questions, audio notes, and
                                    comments to engage students and assess their understanding.

                                    Additionally, Edpuzzle provides analytics and insights into student progress and
                                    performance, allowing educators to track student engagement and identify areas for
                                    improvement.
