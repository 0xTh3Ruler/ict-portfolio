                                    Pedagogical Content Knowledge, is a framework that emphasizes the integration of
                                    technology, pedagogy (teaching methods), and content knowledge to enhance teaching
                                    and learning. Developed by Punya Mishra and Matthew Koehler, TPACK recognizes the
                                    interconnectedness of these three domains and emphasizes the importance of
                                    effectively integrating technology into educational practices to promote meaningful
                                    learning experiences.

                                    traditional notions of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and technological content
                                    knowledge (TCK) by integrating them into a comprehensive framework. It highlights
                                    the need for educators to possess not only subject matter expertise (content
                                    knowledge) and knowledge of effective teaching strategies (pedagogical knowledge)
                                    but also an understanding of how to effectively leverage technology to support and
                                    enhance teaching and learning (technological knowledge).

                                    with a holistic framework for designing and implementing technology-rich learning
                                    environments that are aligned with instructional goals and promote student
                                    engagement, collaboration, and critical thinking. By integrating technology
                                    seamlessly into their teaching practices, educators can create dynamic and
                                    interactive learning experiences that cater to the diverse needs and learning styles
                                    of their students, ultimately fostering deeper learning and knowledge construction.
